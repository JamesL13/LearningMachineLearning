# LearningMachineLearning

This is just a space for me to push to git some of the exercises I am doing to learn Machine Learning.

<b>Environment is: </b>
<ul>
<li>WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows 10</li>

<li>Python 3.8.2</li>

<li>Visual Studio Code connected to WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04</li>

<li>Ryzen 9 3900x</li>

<li>GTX 1080</li>

<li>Using Tensorflow 2.3 on CPU</li>
</ul>

Currently using the SentDex Python Machine Learning Tutorials

The plan is to switch to GPU once wsl2 GPU support is released to a beta branch of Windows
